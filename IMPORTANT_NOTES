#version 0.27:
The schema has changed in this version. Be sure to run vrpipe-db_upgrade if you
have used a previous version of VRPipe.

# versions 0.01-current:
a) Only MySQL is fully supported so far, though it may work with other dbs.
b) There is currently an issue with indexing certain columns that are too large
   to be specified as varchars. After running vrpipe-db_deploy you will have
   to manually connect to your production database and issue the following SQL:
   create index path_index on file path(255);
   create index output_root_index on scheduler (output_root(255));
   create index cmd_dir_index on job (cmd(255), dir(255));
   create index requirements_index on requirements (custom(255));
   create index result_index on dataelement (result(255));
   create index source_options_index on datasource (source(255), options(255));
   create index outputroot_options_index on pipelinesetup (output_root(255), options(255));
   create index allowed_values_index on stepoption (allowed_values(255));
   create index metadata_index on stepiodefinition (metadata(255));
   create index summary_index on stepcmdsummary (summary(255));
