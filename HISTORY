0.25    New StepStats system for quick access to memory/time used stats
0.24    Critical fix for mapping pipeline
0.23    New Stampy mapping pipline. Fixes for SNP and DCC pipelines
0.22    Critical fix for input files that are relative symlinks
0.21    SNP discovery pipeline(s) now firming up; fixes for merging
        pipelines
0.20    Improved handling of limits, so that a good amount of jobs are
        always running
0.19    Various fixes to 1000 genomes-related pipelines
0.18    Fix to allow sqlite to be used in production
0.17    Install process for new external users should now work/be easy
0.16    New merging pipelines and associated vrpipe datasource (for chaining
        different pipelines together). Critical bug fixes that allow
        changes in datasources to trigger restarts for the changed
        elements.
0.15    Front-end for creating PipelineSetups; improvements to smalt
        mapping so we can map 454 data in 1000 genomes.
0.14    More front-end scripts added. Sequence index datasource now
        starts changed elements over from scratch, so we can now change
        the source file safely.
0.13    Various fixes for pipelines. Memory leak issues fixed. Various
        front-end scripts added.
0.12    Fixes for bam_mapping_with_bwa. New VCF annotation-related steps
        and pipelines. Triggering pipelines in Manager has been optimised
        slightly
0.11    Fixes for bam_mapping_with_bwa. New smalt mapping pipeline for
        handling 454 sequence data.
0.10    Bam Improvement steps now fully implemented. New bam_mapping_with_bwa
        pipeline
0.09    Scheduler independence: local can now be used for testing
0.08    Submission retries now add time where necessary
0.07    Fixed critical bug in mapping pipeline; should now work properly
0.06    Myriad performance and stability improvements necessary to get the
        mapping pipeline running smoothly
0.05    Critical performance fix for dealing with large datasources
0.04    Critical performance fix for checking bam file type
0.03    0.02 only worked on test dataset; this should be the first version to
        work on real data, following important schema changes and Step fixes
0.02    Most interesting features not yet implemented, but this is the first
        working version, needed to do the 1000genomes phase2 (re)mapping
0.01    No real files; just starting up repository
