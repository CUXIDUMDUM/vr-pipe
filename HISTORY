0.43    Efficiency fix for vrtrack datasource.
0.42    Critical fix for vrtrack datasource, so that it now updates
        file metadata when vrtrack metadata changes.
0.41    vrtrack_update_improved step now sets lane reads and bases.
0.40    Critical fix for vrtrack_update_mapstats step, letting it
        work without exome_targets_file.
0.39    vrpipe DataSource behaviour changed, so that a child pipeline
        that deletes inputs won't mess up a parent that still needs
        those files. Overhauled the genotype checking pipeline and
        steps.
0.38	Fix for gatk_target_interval_creator step, increasing its
        default memory reservation.
0.37    Overhaul of qc graphs & stats-related steps and pipelines
        so that now wgs and exome projects all use the same
        pipeline, with a single bamcheck call. bam_to_fastq step
        fixed so that it runs in constant <500MB and copes with
        bams that miss reads.
0.36    Critical fixes to the underlying system to ensure job
        submission doesn't stall out forever, to handle limits on
        steps better, and to avoid issues when there are multiple
        submissions for the same job. Also a fix for java to increase
        likelyhood of jvm starting up.
0.35    vrpipe-status script improved to give a better overview of
        what the pipeline is doing, with warnings about pipeline
        stalls. bam_to_fastq step reimplemented, should now be much
        better.
0.34    Critical speed fix for the VRTrack datasource. Fixes for the
        archive_files pipeline and the vrtrack_update_mapstats step.
0.33    Optimised bam_import_from_irods_and_vrtrack_qc_wgs pipeline.
        Memory and time reserved for jobs is now less likely to be
        insufficient.
0.32    Fixes for bam_mapping_with_bwa_via_fastq and bam_reheader step.
        Efficiency improvement in how step max_simultaneous is handled.
0.31    Database independence now properly implemented. New separate
        bam improvement pipeline, remapping bams via fastq pipeline,
        and some Sanger-specific pipelines added.
0.30    Fixes related to archive_files pipeline.
0.29    New archive_files pipeline.
0.28    Really fix java-using steps so they get the memory they need
0.27    Outputs of near-identical PipelineSetups will now never risk
        overwriting themselves. Java-using steps get better recommended
        memory. New IMPORTANT_NOTES file - you must read this!
0.26    Critical performance fix for StepStats
0.25    New StepStats system for quick access to memory/time used stats
0.24    Critical fix for mapping pipeline
0.23    New Stampy mapping pipline. Fixes for SNP and DCC pipelines
0.22    Critical fix for input files that are relative symlinks
0.21    SNP discovery pipeline(s) now firming up; fixes for merging
        pipelines
0.20    Improved handling of limits, so that a good amount of jobs are
        always running
0.19    Various fixes to 1000 genomes-related pipelines
0.18    Fix to allow sqlite to be used in production
0.17    Install process for new external users should now work/be easy
0.16    New merging pipelines and associated vrpipe datasource (for chaining
        different pipelines together). Critical bug fixes that allow
        changes in datasources to trigger restarts for the changed
        elements.
0.15    Front-end for creating PipelineSetups; improvements to smalt
        mapping so we can map 454 data in 1000 genomes.
0.14    More front-end scripts added. Sequence index datasource now
        starts changed elements over from scratch, so we can now change
        the source file safely.
0.13    Various fixes for pipelines. Memory leak issues fixed. Various
        front-end scripts added.
0.12    Fixes for bam_mapping_with_bwa. New VCF annotation-related steps
        and pipelines. Triggering pipelines in Manager has been optimised
        slightly
0.11    Fixes for bam_mapping_with_bwa. New smalt mapping pipeline for
        handling 454 sequence data.
0.10    Bam Improvement steps now fully implemented. New bam_mapping_with_bwa
        pipeline
0.09    Scheduler independence: local can now be used for testing
0.08    Submission retries now add time where necessary
0.07    Fixed critical bug in mapping pipeline; should now work properly
0.06    Myriad performance and stability improvements necessary to get the
        mapping pipeline running smoothly
0.05    Critical performance fix for dealing with large datasources
0.04    Critical performance fix for checking bam file type
0.03    0.02 only worked on test dataset; this should be the first version to
        work on real data, following important schema changes and Step fixes
0.02    Most interesting features not yet implemented, but this is the first
        working version, needed to do the 1000genomes phase2 (re)mapping
0.01    No real files; just starting up repository
